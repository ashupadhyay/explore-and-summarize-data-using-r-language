# explore-and-summarize-data-using-r-language

## What were my learnings?
After completing the project, I was able to:
- Understand the distribution of a variable and to check for anomalies and outliers
- Learn how to quantify and visualize individual variables within a data set by using appropriate plots such as scatter plots, histograms, bar charts, and box plots
- Explore variables to identify the most important variables and relationships within a data set before building predictive models; calculate correlations, and investigate conditional means
- Learn powerful methods and visualizations for examining relationships among multiple variables, such as reshaping data frames and using aesthetics like color and shape to uncover more information

## Why is this Important to my Career?
In this project, I learnt the skills to frame and present data. Data, by itself, is "ubiquitous and cheap," says Google's Chief Economist and UC Berkeley professor Hal Varian. What you do as a data analyst is take that data and turn it into insights.

When working on this project, it made me think about the insights I was trying to provide. Because I know, when speaking to an employer, this is what they want to first hear about.
